# Medical Statistics Projects
### Midterm Project: Analyzing a medical dataset based on a desired hypothesis using statistical tests  
The code consists of performing a set of statistical tests on the MRI anatomic volume results from OASIS-2 dataset and visualizing the distribution of them among different subject groups. The goal was to find a relationship between the size of nWBV (normalized whole-brain volume) and dementia level (non-demented, demented, and converted) and to see whether subjects classified as demented or converted (converted to demented over the study period) have a smaller nWBV on average compared to the non-demented group. In the 
The OASIS-2 dataset is a collection of longitudinal brain MRI scans from 150 subjects aged 60 to 96.
The scans for each subject were acquired during their yearly visits. Since the number of visits for each subject was different, the latest nWBV results were only used.
